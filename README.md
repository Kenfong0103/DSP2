This study delves into the potential of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to revolutionize stainless steel surface defect detection. The objective is to enhance defect identification and classification capabilities by combining CNN with advanced camera-based detection methods, overcoming traditional limitations, and transforming quality assurance practices. The methodology involves data collection, preprocessing, training of custom CNN, and comparison with pre-trained models, which are VGG19 and InceptionV3. Results demonstrate the stability and accuracy of VGG19 in detecting various defects, including crazing, inclusions, patches, pitted surfaces, rolled-in scale, scratches, and no defect, with confidence levels exceeding 99%. Furthermore, deployment of the VGG19 model on Streamlit showcases a user-friendly interface, promising significant improvements in production efficiency and quality control standards in the construction industry. The innovative defect detection system proposed in this study has the potential to streamline industrial processes, saving substantial time and costs while enhancing quality control standards.
